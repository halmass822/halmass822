Hi, Iâ€™m Hazem

Currently working in emergency communications, looking to become a Software Developer. [Please visit my portfolio](https://hazem.almassri.ca/)

I've been learning coding since august 2021 and I am starting with the PERN stack. My repositories represent my learning progress so far

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, particularly from a career switcher perspective.

Thanks for reading!
