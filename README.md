Hi, Iâ€™m halmass822

Currently working in emergency communications, looking to become a software developer!

I have been learning coding now for 3 months, primarily learning javascript and back end coding on codecademy.com.
I'm absolutely hooked on the greater understanding I get from the world around me as I build my coding knowledge

I have completed numerous courses on codecademy with a particular focus on node.js back end using express.js as well as numerous other unrelated courses to further my knowledge

I have learned to have a good balance between theoretical and practical learning even though I greatly prefer the latter

I'm hoping to learn lots from experienced and amateur programmers on github and cement my knowledge through practice

Thank you for reading!
